## Chat Panel Visual Hierarchy (T0030)

Design spec addressing visual consistency issues in the chat panel.

**Location**: `shared/specs/chat-visual-hierarchy.md`

**Mockups**:
- `shared/specs/chat-hierarchy-option-a.html` (recommended)
- `shared/specs/chat-hierarchy-option-c.html` (fallback)

**Summary**: Reduces font sizes from 5 to 2, gray palette from 5 to 3 colors, eliminates icon alignment issues, and replaces opacity-based hierarchy with purposeful font-weight and color choices.

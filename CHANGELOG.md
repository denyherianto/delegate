# Changelog

All notable changes to Delegate are documented here.

## 0.2.7 — 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Auto-generated environment scripts** — deterministic `setup.sh` and `premerge.sh` generation for agent worktrees. Detects Python (uv/pip/poetry), Node (npm/pnpm/yarn), Rust, Go, Ruby, and Nix stacks with multi-language and workspace-aware composition. Parses `.envrc` for direnv-based projects.
- **3-tier install strategy** — Python and Node setup scripts prioritize copying from the main repo's environment, then installing from the shared cache (offline), and finally falling back to a full network install. Uses `_cp_tree` with copy-on-write (APFS clones / reflinks) for near-instant, zero-overhead copies.
- **Network domain allowlist** — curated default list of ~30 package-manager and git-forge domains (PyPI, npm, crates.io, proxy.golang.org, rubygems, Maven Central, NuGet, Hackage, Hex, etc.) replaces the previous unrestricted wildcard. Managed via `delegate network show/allow/disallow/reset`.
- **Team-shared package-manager cache** — `.pkg-cache/` directory at the team level with per-language subdirectories, injected via `settings.env` into every agent sandbox session. Covers pip, uv, npm, yarn, pnpm, Cargo, Go modules, Bundler, Gradle, Maven, NuGet, Pub, Composer, Hex, and Mix.
- **Rate-limit toast** — monkey-patch for Claude SDK's unhandled `rate_limit_event` message type surfaces a yellow warning toast in the UI instead of crashing the agent turn.
- **Delete project** — button with confirmation modal in project settings.
- **`FileAutocomplete` component** — server-side file/directory path completion with git-repo badge, wired into the New Project modal's repo path field.
- **Clickable file paths** — file paths in chat messages open in the built-in file viewer instead of the browser.
- **Sidebar footer** — Give Feedback link, version display, and update-available modal.
- **Active Tasks widget redesign** — new layout in the Mission Control right sidebar with live timers and streaming thinking text.
- **Nudge turns** — runtime detects when an agent ends a turn without sending any messages and automatically nudges it to continue.
- **`GET /api/version`** endpoint for programmatic version checks.
- **File completion API** — `GET /api/files/complete` and `GET /api/files/list` endpoints for path autocompletion.
- **Marketing website** and branding assets.

### Changed
- **Teams → Projects** — storage layer rename (directories, DB tables, config keys) with automatic migration of existing installations.
- **Merge worker simplified** — runs entirely in the merge worktree; removed the read-write lock and separate worktree lifecycle.
- **Pre-merge script system replaced** — removed the per-repo configurable premerge registration system in favor of auto-generated scripts.
- **Rebase commit messages** now include the task title.
- **Default agent count** changed to 5 with explanatory help text in the New Project modal.
- **Human name auto-detected** from `git config user.name` at `delegate start`; removed the heal-after-the-fact fallback.
- **Agent names** auto-generated from the name pool in the Create Project modal.
- **Charter hardened** — environment isolation, setup script creation guidance, Python anti-patterns, explicit network-availability nudges, and per-language setup templates.
- **Manager ack behavior** — charter instructs manager to send an acknowledgment and then continue working in the same turn.
- **`/shell -d` renamed to `--cwd`**.
- **Reflection frequency** lowered.
- **Auto-setup team creation** removed from `delegate start`.

### Fixed
- **Playwright E2E tests** — fixed greeting tests (localStorage prefix derivation, API mocking), keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K / Cmd+1-9 now work when chat input is focused), reviewer edit modal selectors (`.file-ac-input`), and sidebar toggle stability.
- **Welcome message for new projects** — now sent synchronously during project creation instead of relying on a racy frontend call.
- **`last-greeted` tracking** scoped per team to fix missing greetings on team switch.
- **SSE connection** for zero-teams installs and new project creation.
- **`FileAutocomplete`** dropdown reopening after selection and appearing when unfocused.
- **Version detection** — fallback chain through `importlib.metadata` → `pyproject.toml` → `None`, with guarded `update_available` check.
- **File completion API** — default to home dir when path is empty, expand `~` in paths.
- **Pre-merge test crash** — added `stdin=DEVNULL` to subprocess calls.
- **Tab key** skipping Merge Preview in task panel.
- **Teams→Projects rename** — fixed Python variable / SQL column name collisions, hardened migration script.
- **DRI merge state gate** removed from turn dispatcher.
- Various styling fixes: sidebar footer alignment, iframe height, chat message padding, thinking box, shell output toolbar, agent hint text class.

## 0.2.6 — 2026-02-18

### Added
- **UI overhaul** — three-panel layout (sidebar, main chat, right activity panel) with shared workspace header showing the active project name.
- **Delegate thinking footer** — glass card in the main chat panel streams Delegate's live thinking word-by-word with tool entries, context labels ("responding to Nikhil", "working on T123"), and auto-scroll. Clicking the header opens Delegate's side panel.
- **Mission Control sidebar** — per-project agents + active tasks with live elapsed timers, streaming thinking text, and tool epoch tracking. Agents and tasks in independently scrollable sections.
- **Sidebar polish** — collapsible sidebar with notification bell + badge, project list with activity dots, green accent bar on active project, hidden scrollbars, softer hover states.
- **Reviewer edit modal** — CodeMirror 6 editor replaces the plain textarea for reviewing agent edits.
- **Task panel improvements** — keyboard shortcuts, search icon with expand/collapse, styled empty states, live timers on agent and task detail panels.
- **File diffs in agent cards** — show diffs on task completion.
- **PWA support** — manifest, service worker, install/use-app banners, macOS standalone launch helper.
- **Syntax highlighting** — full highlight.js library with `highlightAuto()` fallback for unlisted extensions.
- **Repo instruction injection** — repo-level instruction files included in agent preamble.
- **Project name validation** — CLI and API reject invalid project names.

### Changed
- **Thinking accumulation** — backend sends full accumulated thinking text with `---` tool-break markers instead of truncated snippets; frontend uses epochs to cycle tool display.
- **Human message priority** — `_select_batch` ensures human messages form exclusive batches for clear turn attribution.
- **Manager sandbox** — `.git/` write access granted to manager agent.
- **Merge rework** — pre-merge tests run in agent worktree with async read-write locking and exponential backoff on worktree errors.
- **Default model** — changed to `sonnet` for all roles including manager.
- **Reflection tuning** — probability reduced from 10% to 5%.
- **Green message border** — moved from human messages to Delegate messages.
- **Chat filters** — bidi default, pill-based redesign, agent-to-agent messages filtered out.
- **`prettyName` utility** — consistent project name display across all locations.

### Fixed
- Duplicate `merge_task()` calls for same-cycle tasks.
- `isBoss` reference error in ChatPanel (now `isDelegate`).
- PillSelect showing raw name when option not found.
- Agent filtering to current team in Mission Control.
- Live timer invisible on dark background.
- Selection tooltip not appearing on quick mouse selection.
- Spurious dot after agent name in comment events.
- ApproveDialog modal opacity and styling.
- Task row timer/badge alignment in Mission Control.

## 0.2.5 — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Persistent agent conversations (Telephone)** — agents now maintain a single persistent Claude subprocess across turns via `ClaudeSDKClient`, eliminating process-per-turn overhead. Conversations auto-rotate when the context window fills, summarising state into memory for the next generation.
- **Prompt class** — extracted prompt building from `agent.py` into a dedicated `Prompt` class with composable methods for charter, task context, message history, and reflection prompts.
- **OS-level bash sandboxing** — agents run with macOS Seatbelt / Linux bubblewrap isolation via `claude-agent-sdk`. Bash commands are kernel-restricted to the delegate home directory, platform temp directory, and registered repo `.git/` directories; writes outside are blocked at the OS level regardless of what the model attempts.
- **Surgical repo `.git/` sandbox access** — each registered repo's `.git/` directory is added to the sandbox `add_dirs`, allowing `git add`/`git commit` inside worktrees while keeping the repo working tree read-only to bash and blocking git operations on unregistered repos.
- **Daemon-managed worktree lifecycle** — `git worktree add`, branch creation, merge, and cleanup now run exclusively in the unsandboxed daemon process. `task.create()` records only the DB row and branch name; the daemon's `_ensure_task_infra()` creates worktrees before dispatching agent turns, eliminating sandbox conflicts.
- **Automatic Telephone replacement on repo change** — if a new repo is registered mid-session, the agent's Telephone is automatically closed and recreated with updated `add_dirs` containing the new repo's `.git/` path.
- **Write-path enforcement per role** — managers can write anywhere under the team directory; engineers are restricted to their agent directory, task worktree(s), and the team `shared/` folder. Enforced via `can_use_tool` callback on every tool invocation.
- **Migrated to `claude-agent-sdk`** — replaced `claude-code-sdk` (v0.0.25) with `claude-agent-sdk` (v0.1.36), which bundles the Claude Code CLI binary (no separate `npm install` required) and adds native `SandboxSettings` support.
- **`/agent add` slash command** — spawn new agents from the chat UI without touching the CLI.
- **Agents page redesign** — row layout grouped by teams, with unified Messages tab (merged inbox/outbox), contextual turn labels, and persistent activity logs with turn dividers.
- **Task panel redesign** — improved hierarchy, metadata display, and virtualized diff rendering (plain HTML for comment-free lines) for better performance on large diffs.
- **Scroll-to-bottom shortcut** — keyboard shortcut to jump to the latest message, plus a two-column help modal for discovering all shortcuts.
- **Individual idle agents in sidebar** — sidebar now shows each idle agent individually instead of a count, with gray dots for idle teams.
- **One-shot frontend build on `delegate start`** — ensures the frontend bundle is fresh on every daemon start, even without `--dev`.
- **PyPI wheel includes frontend static assets** — added `force-include` directive so the gitignored `delegate/static/` directory is correctly packaged in the wheel.

### Changed
- **Defense-in-depth permissioning** — four independent layers now enforce write isolation: (1) `can_use_tool` callback blocks Edit/Write tools outside allowed paths, (2) `disallowed_tools` hides dangerous git commands at the SDK level, (3) OS sandbox restricts all bash file writes at the kernel level, (4) daemon-only worktree/branch lifecycle operations.
- **Consolidated token usage tracking** — replaced scattered `TurnTokens` / `_collect_tokens_from_message` implementations with a single `TelephoneUsage` class that handles extraction, arithmetic, and accumulation.
- **`--repo` now required** on `delegate team add` — the manager charter is updated to reflect this. Review commit gate relaxed (no longer requires a commit before submitting for review).
- **Agent name optional** in `/agent add` — omitting the name auto-generates one from the name pool.
- **Merge conflict notifications simplified** — now show only the conflicting file list instead of verbose git output.
- **Markdown rendering performance** — cached and memoized markdown-to-HTML conversion to avoid redundant re-parses on every render cycle.
- **Chat toolbar icons** — updated to cleaner `+`, speaker, and header bell icons.
- **Cmd+K team switcher disabled on non-chat pages** — prevents accidental team switches while browsing tasks or agents.

### Fixed
- **Task panel tabs snapping back to Overview** — signal subscription in render body caused full re-renders on every poll; refactored to use `tasks.peek()` and `effect()` for subscriptions, hardened tab state persistence.
- **Task panel stuck on "Loading"** — `.peek()` used for signal reads that don't need reactivity, preventing unnecessary re-render cascades.
- **Agent usage stats showing same numbers across teams** — fixed cross-team stat leakage.
- **Uploaded files not viewable** — file viewer iframe path resolution fixed.
- **Task page team flicker on approval** — eliminated a reactivity loop during approval transitions.
- **Agent panel layout** — message header alignment and tab ordering fixed.
- **File path regex** — now correctly matches directory paths (not just files).
- **Sidebar Active Teams widget** — hides idle teams, uses gray dots for status.
- **Toast and file viewer button colors** — close button and action button colors corrected.
- **Status command styling** — removed green links and parentheses from `/status` output.
- **Activity log lookup** — uses `findLast` for newest entry instead of first match.
- **Welcome message** — removed spurious API key check that could show false warnings.

## 0.2.4 — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **SharedWorker SSE multiplexing** — a `SharedWorker` maintains a single SSE connection to `/stream` shared across all browser tabs, with automatic fallback to direct `EventSource` when `SharedWorker` is unavailable. Unlimited tabs now share 1 HTTP connection.
- **Batch agent stats endpoint** — `GET /teams/{team}/agents/stats` returns stats for all agents in a single `GROUP BY` query, replacing N individual per-agent requests.

### Changed
- **esbuild watcher gated behind `--dev` flag** — `delegate start` no longer auto-starts the esbuild frontend watcher in dev checkouts. Use `delegate start --dev` to enable live frontend rebuilds. This avoids unnecessary node processes and potential startup delays in normal usage.
- **Single global SSE stream** — frontend opens one `EventSource` to `/stream` instead of one per team, eliminating browser connection pool exhaustion when multiple tabs are open.
- **Content-hash cache busting** — static assets (`app.js`, `styles.css`) served with `?v={hash}` derived from file contents, ensuring browsers always fetch the latest bundle after rebuilds or upgrades without manual version bumps.
- **`/bootstrap` performance** — eliminated redundant `ensure_schema` checks, batched agent stats into a single `GROUP BY` query, and reduced per-team agent counting to a cheap directory listing; ~80% faster cold bootstrap.
- **Agent stats deferred to agents tab** — polling loop only fetches agent stats when the agents tab is active, eliminating unnecessary DB round-trips on chat and tasks views.

### Fixed
- **`team remove` not cleaning up database** — removed teams still appeared in the UI because the `teams` table row was never deleted; now cleaned up on removal.
- **UI hang with multiple tabs** — per-team SSE connections exhausted the browser's 6-connection HTTP/1.1 pool; switching to a single global stream freed connections for normal API requests.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`/bootstrap` endpoint** — single API call returns config, teams, and initial team data (tasks, agents, stats, messages), replacing the 5+ request waterfall on app load.
- **Self-hosted fonts** — Inter and JetBrains Mono served from the bundle via `@fontsource`, eliminating external Google Fonts requests and FOUT.

### Changed
- App startup refactored to use `/bootstrap` — first meaningful paint no longer blocked by sequential API calls.
- Polling loop no longer fires immediately on mount; defers to the interval timer so it doesn't race with bootstrap data.
- Task panel prefetch deferred by 5 seconds to avoid competing with initial render.

### Fixed
- **UI hang on server restart** — `fetchBootstrap` catch block now falls back to individual API calls when the endpoint is unavailable (e.g., old server still running), instead of silently swallowing the error and leaving the app blank.
- **`greet_team` crash** — `Message` dataclass accessed via dict syntax (`m["sender"]`) instead of attribute access (`m.sender`); fixed to use dot notation.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Roadmap section in README** — documented upcoming features (sandboxing, external integrations, remote repos, team templates).
- **Local-first note in README** — clarified that Delegate currently works with local git repos, with remote/external tool support on the roadmap.

### Changed
- `/status` command redesigned — task-focused, concise output replacing the verbose previous format.
- `/diff` command shows red-bordered error block on failures instead of silently failing.
- API key error message now lists three clear options with examples: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `delegate start --env-file`, and `claude login`.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Empty-state modal** — guided setup screen when no teams are configured.
- **Animated thinking indicator** — manager activity bar cycles through synonyms ("thinking…", "reasoning…", "pondering…") with smooth transitions.
- **Task approve/reject shortcuts** — `Ctrl+Enter` to approve, `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to reject when the approval textarea is focused.
- **Agent inbox task badges** — task IDs shown as badges in agent inbox messages.
- **`/cost` command** — view token usage and cost breakdown per task inline in chat.
- **Slash command usage hints** — autocomplete items show argument descriptions.

### Changed
- Task panel rendering optimized with progressive diff loading, memoization, and lazy activity fetch.
- Cost summary task IDs styled in gray-scale (matching system task-id pattern) instead of green links.
- Toast borders changed from colored to neutral for a cleaner look.
- Reply blockquote spacing improved (blank line after quote).
- Playwright test suite stabilized for flat URLs, new components, and webkit timing.
- CI: frontend build skipped in pytest job; playwright steps reordered.

### Fixed
- `selectTeam` TDZ crash — `useCallback` declaration moved above the `useEffect` that depends on it, fixing a `ReferenceError` that broke the entire app on load.
- Cmd+K team switcher arrow key delay caused by re-registering keyboard handlers on every render.
- `/cost` command 500 error (missing `get_connection` import).
- `CollapsibleMessage` ref forwarding issue.
- Git `init -b main` in multi-team test fixture (CI compatibility).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Workflow engine** — define custom task lifecycles in Python with stages, transitions, and hooks. Ships with a default `todo → in_progress → in_review → in_approval → merging → done` workflow.
- **Zero-config first run** — `delegate start` auto-detects your name, creates a team, registers the CWD repo, and greets you with a welcome message.
- **System user** — automated actions (task creation, status changes, merge events) are attributed to a `system` user instead of a team member.
- **Human members model** — replaces the single "boss" with proper human member identities stored in `~/.delegate/members/`. Humans can belong to multiple teams.
- **Multi-team isolation** — messages, tasks, and events are properly scoped per team. Cross-team message leakage fixed.
- **Merge preview tab** — view diff against `main` in the task panel without merging.
- **Squash-reapply fallback** — when rebase conflicts occur during merge, attempt a squash-reapply before escalating to the DRI.
- **Side panel stacking** — clicking links in a panel opens a new panel on top with a "Back" button.
- **Slash commands** — `/shell` to run commands, `/diff` to view task diffs inline. Autocomplete with Tab/Enter.
- **Audio notifications** — sounds for tasks needing approval and completed tasks.
- **Task prefetch** — task panel data loads instantly via prefetch on hover.
- **Cmd+K team switcher** — quick keyboard shortcut to switch between teams.
- **Configurable charter presets** — "quality first" and "ship fast" variants.
- **Global task endpoints** — access tasks without team context for cross-team views.
- **Agent name pool** — random agent names on team creation.

### Changed
- Manager identity standardized to `delegate` (removed `--manager` CLI option).
- Agent names must be unique within a team but no longer globally.
- URL routing simplified — flat `/chat`, `/tasks`, `/agents` paths.
- Chat input changed to `contentEditable` div for better UX.
- Sidebar redesigned with grouped teams and idle summary.
- Keyboard shortcuts respect input focus (no interference while typing).

### Fixed
- File viewer loading ("File loading..." on attachment clicks).
- Team selector dropdown not showing options after first use.
- Orphaned `esbuild` processes on shutdown.
- Manager activity indicator disappearing randomly.
- Shell command `~` expansion and error display.
- Timestamp alignment across message types.
